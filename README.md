## Disclaimer & Ethical Use

This project features chatbots designed to mimic the conversational style and persona of various public figures based on publicly available data and creative interpretation. These chatbots do **not** represent the real thoughts, beliefs, or opinions of the individuals depicted. All responses are generated by AI and are for educational, experimental, or entertainment purposes only.

**Please use responsibly.**  
Do not present these chatbots or their outputs as genuine statements from the actual persons.

## Datasets

All persona datasets are in the `datasets/` folder:
- `warhol_data.csv`
- `basquiat_data.csv`

Each CSV has the following columns:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
